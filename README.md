# Azure Resume Challenge
This is my Cloud Resume Challenge built on Azure.

## Introduction ðŸ“‘
Iâ€™ve been inspired by the Cloud Resume Challenge by A Cloud Guru. I used Visual Studio Code with the Azure Tools extension pack and .NET 8.0 LTS in an in-process model, along with the necessary NuGet packages. The core of the solution is stored in Azure Blob Storage, which hosts the static website for my resume. The website is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. JavaScript is used to implement a visitor counter, which not only displays the count but also makes API calls and integrates with an Azure Function. This Azure Function interacts with Azure Cosmos DB, the database service used to store the visitor counter information.
I utilized Azure CDN to enable features like HTTPS and custom domain support for the static site deployed on Azure Blob Storage. GitHub is used for all CI/CD tooling. I created an Azure Cosmos DB account and database, built the backend container, and added the counter data to that container. The Azure Function was developed locally in Visual Studio Code with the Azure Functions extension. I set up Cosmos DB bindings to retrieve and update the counter data, deployed the Azure Function, and retrieved the function URL. I then updated the JavaScript code with the function URL and deployed the website to Blob Storage. After that, I set up Azure CDN and HTTPS support and configured my custom domain.
Next, I built the CI/CD pipeline using GitHub. I created a frontend workflow responsible for deploying any changes made to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also implemented unit tests to test my Azure Functions code and included them in the CI/CD pipeline.

## Front-end resources

The front-end is a static site with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's static and has a visitor counter. The visitor counter data fetched via an API call to an Azure Function.

- This [article](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-the-javascript-fetch-api-to-get-data) explains how to make an API call with JavaScript and in a simple way how to use it to make an API call.

## Back-end resources

The back-end is an [HTTP triggered](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger?tabs=csharp) Azure Functions with Cosmos DB input and output binding. The Function is triggered, it retrieves the CosmosDB item, add +1 to it, and saves it and returns its value to the caller.
